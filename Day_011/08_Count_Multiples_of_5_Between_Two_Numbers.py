8. Count Multiples of 5 Between Two Numbers
A supermarket gives coupons to customers whose token numbers are multiples of 5. The manager enters a token range and wants to know how many eligible token numbers exist.
Write a program to count numbers divisible by 5 between two given numbers using loops.

Input:
1 20

Output:
Count = 4

'''
num1, num2 = map(int,input().split())

count = 0 


for i in range(num1, num2+1):
    if i % 5 == 0:
        count += 1
print(count)
